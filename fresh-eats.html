                                            food services like Hello Fresh or Factor. The objective behind this product was to utilize PHP and MySQL to create a login and sign up process and save accounts
                                            within a database as well as validating user information. You could also implement any other PHP functionality of your choosing.</p>

                                        <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-5">As an incomplete prototype to the Fresh Eats web application, Fresh Eats focuses on some core funtionality.
                                            First and foremost, the application is responsive, as all applications should be. Then, functionality for a log in and sign up process needed to be implemented to ensure
                                            that a user could not access the site unless they already had an account. Next, the (imaginary) client wanted a carousel to be implemented into the site that, when in a mobile viewport,
                                            the user would be able to press a button to see the next image. Lastly, the client wanted beautiful photos that were vibrant and enticing.

                                    </section>

                                            <p class = "lh-lg fs-5">Before adding in functionality, the HTML and CSS for the website was built from scratch. No template
                                                and no frameworks. The website layout was built utilizing a grid system and media quieries for responsiveness. Within the HTML, semantics were
                                                used to make navigating the site easier for those who use screen readers and to optimize for search engines. I believe it is always good to have
                                                a great HTML and CSS foundation before adding any functionality and with this site I aimed to do just that.

                                                    If $_SESSION not equal to true, the user will have to make an account and will not be able to continue until they do.

                                                        While creating the structure of the HTML for this carousel was no hard task, the complexity came when positioning the radio buttons in HTML and CSS. The "buttons" that users
                                                        click on to move the carousel, are just labels corresponding to their respective input, which in this case the input are radio buttons.
                                                        As you will see in the CSS, we can create a moving carousel by changing the positions of the photo relative to the first photo, which was given a class of ".first"(this is important!), within the gallery.

                                                    the photos lined up all in one row, however in doing so we have an overflow of content that stretches the page. With the overflow in ".position-rel" 
                                                    set to hidden, we easily fix this issue. Next we need to set the width of each photo (13%) and set a transition time (2s). With most of the styling 
                                                    issues out of the way, we can focus on how we are going to utilize CSS to actually move the photos!
                                                </p>
                                                <p class = "fs-4 lh-lm"> Through using the CSS pseudo-class selector ":checked" we get to set rules to the photos whenever one of the radio buttons get "checked."
                                                    Remember how we labled the very first photo with a class of "first"? This and the general sibling combinator (~) is the key to how it all works!
                                                    When the user checks a radio box, we set the margin further to the left depending on which iteration it is on from the very first photo. 
                                                    It is a pretty neat CSS trick!
