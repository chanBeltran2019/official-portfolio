                                 After doing all of our UX Research, we had to create both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
                            <p class = "fs-4 lh-md text-white"> Lastly, we had to have a fully functioning prototype of our creation by a certain deadline. My team and I chose to create a gym application that we thought embodied the current fitness community best.
                                Even though we envisioned this application working on both mobile and the web, we decided just to prototype the mobile version.</p>

                            <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-4">There are already so many apps created for gym users, what makes this one necessary? What problem does it solve that has not been solved already?
                                 During our research in comparing around fifteen different fitness applications, we realized there was a heavy gap in the market matrix: a way to socialize with other gym goers and people of the fitness community. </p>
                            <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-4"> With the fitness community growing rapidly and taking over social media with workout tips and high-protein food recipes,
                                 it is becoming increasingly important to implement features that encourage users to socialize within a fitness app so they do not need to chat with like-minded individuals elsewhere.</p>
                            <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-4">We also noticed a lack of features that enabled users to find and book a trainer in their area within the app. All of the features we defined as important had to be found in separate applications.
                                 With our app, we aimed to fix that problem and have everything the user might need in one place.</p>

                        <p class = "lh-lg fs-4">To begin, we started by creating a feature/function matrix to see what apps on the current market had to offer and what they were lacking.
                             Our research concluded that only 33% of the fitness apps had any sort of direct messaging and 47% included features to help find trainers. We also noted the importance of smartwatches and their compatibility with fitness apps and were surprised to see less than half of the applications had the option to pair with a smartwatch.</p>
                             <p class = "lh-lg fs-4">Some of the most common features, however, were gym logs, profiles, memberships, and videos. Using this data, we made sure to implement these features within our app to give users the best experience.</p>
