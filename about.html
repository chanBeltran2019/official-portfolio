                                Design accessibility is also a very important topic for me. I have a great passion for this industry and intend to use it! Having recently graduated
                                from the University of Central Florida with my Bachelor’s degree in Digital Media, I am more than elated to put my skills out in the real world to make a difference.</p>

                <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-6 header-padding"> I am a senior at the University of Central Florida and will earn my Digital Media Bachelor's Degree on the Web Design track in the Spring of 2022.
                Not knowing what I wanted to do when I came out of high-school, I somehow found myself where I belong, in the world of coding and designing. Coming from a family
                of computer engineers and designers, it only came naturally to me to choose this route. My passion for the industry stems beyond just coding and designing. The idea 
                that I can help ease everyday life for people and make a difference in the content that I produce excites and motivates me beyond reason.
                  </p>
                <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-6 header-padding">
                    I consider myself a very involved student and always looking for opportunities to grow and learn. Yearning for growth, I joined the Nicholson School of Communication and Media Alumni Mentorship Program. Through this mentor and mentee relationship, I get to learn from a Project Manager who oversees Front-End and Back-End Developers, as well as Designers. This experience has been greatly beneficial, as I am more confident going into the workforce knowing more about how the industry works. 
                </p>
                <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-6 header-padding">
                    The workforce is not just about technical experience, however. Part of being a good employee and co-worker is the ability to communicate and work as part of a team. During my senior year of college, I participated in multiple clubs. One of these clubs, SHPE at UCF, taught me how to work with others to achieve a shared goal and how to express ideas in a clear manner. Having the skill to communicate well has been undervalued and it is a skill that many do not have. Knowing this, I took the initiative to put myself in situations where communication was essential and have learned to do it efficiently.
                </p>
                <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-6 header-padding">
                    No person is just their career, however. In my personal life, I liked to bake and am obsessed with dogs. I love dogs so much that I joined STEP at UCF, a service dog training program in which I was able to learn about multiple disabilities and how dogs can help those with disabilities have better lives. I also have a passion for the gym and staying healthy. I believe a good work-life balance leads to greater results in a person’s happiness and productivity.
                </p>
                <p class = " margin-auto lh-lg fs-6 header-padding">
                    With all this knowledge and experience that I have gained, I want to put it to good use in the Web Development industry as well as the community around me. I look forward to all opportunities that may present themselves.
